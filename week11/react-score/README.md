# `react-scores` project

This project contains a simple example of a React application for recording the scores you got with your exams.

It will be developed in phases, in several weeks, to illustrate the different features of React.

* _Phase 1_: just static component rendering, and props-propagation. Uses 'fake' data and does not allow any user interaction.
* _Phase 2_: data manipulation with a form.
* _Phase 3_: implementing routes using React Router v6.
  * _Phase 3.3_: restoring the edit exam functionality through a Location State (nested and dynamic routing were removed).
* _Phase 4_: interacting with APIs.
